Is news a downer? 'Hard' news is often thought to be about 'bad' things in the world. We will test this hypothesis using data from Twitter. 

1. Using the Twitter API, download at least 5000 tweets from 10 media sources (or 500 tweets/media source). One twitter handle = one media source. You get to choose what media sources you want to look at. 
 
2. Code the sentiment of each of the tweets. How you automate coding of sentiment is up to you.   

3. Produce a table, graph, interpret the results carefully.
